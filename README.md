# <em>RungeKutta-4 But inÂ C</em>
<hr>
<h2><i>Introduction:</i></h2>
<p>Discover the C implementation of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, a powerful numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This algorithm balances accuracy and efficiency, making it ideal for dynamic system simulations.</p>
<p>We will be rearranging our equation, storing its coefficients and determining its polynomial's degree in order to solve the <strong>ODE.</strong></p>

<p>In this context, <i>'a'</i> serves as a coefficient, and <i>p(x)</i> represents a polynomial. Our focus lies on the fundamental attributes of polynomials, primarily the <em><strong>Polynomial Degree</strong> and the <strong>Constant term.</strong><em> At this juncture, we are working with straightforward equations, devoid of complexity.</p><br>
